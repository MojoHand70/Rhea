# DECISIONS.md

One line per decision: date, decision, why. Where `SPEC.md` is silent, choices land here
so the next session does not re-derive them.

## 2026-10-01 — bootstrap

- **Postgres runs in Docker (`rhea-postgres`, postgres:17, localhost:5432, volume
  `rhea-pgdata`), not via apt.** Docker is already the established pattern on this
  machine (novi stack runs in it) and keeps the experiment removable; the plan's apt
  option is superseded. Credentials db/user/password `rhea` — local-only experiment.
- **Rule conflict resolution: first match wins by explicit integer `priority`
  (ascending), ties broken by rule id.** SPEC §7 parks real conflict detection; M0 needs
  something deterministic and dumb.
- **Business date for rule effectivity is the event's `occurred_at` date**, carried by
  every raw event; derived events inherit the causing event's business date.

## 2026-10-01 — milestone 0

- **The `rule.*` event-type namespace is system activities** (approvals); the worklist
  query excludes it, so approvals do not sit forever as "unexplained" business events.
- **Money display formatting stays in integer arithmetic end to end**: Go formats minor
  units with `core.FormatMoney`; analysis SQL uses `printf('%d.%02d', x // 100, x % 100)`.
  The DuckDB driver hands DECIMAL back as a float and trims trailing zeros, so DECIMAL
  never crosses into display.
- **Analysis views rebuild the DuckDB projection on every request.** Always fresh, and
  at experiment scale the rebuild costs nothing; incremental projection is an M1+ concern.
- **Shell listens on :8070** — 8080/8083–8085/8091 are taken by the novi stack on this box.
- **Object identity is `<type>-<source_event_id>`**, derived from the log so replay
  reproduces it without any sequence state.
- **A list view finds its detail view by matching `object_type`** across view defs; the
  first match wins. Good enough until a type legitimately has two detail views.
