# Direction notes

Where Rhea is headed beyond the SPEC milestone ladder, and what we learned
from Alpha. SPEC.md stays the design; this records intent so it survives
outside chat history. Written 2026-10-02.

## Two phases of the product story (KK, 2026-10-01)

**(a) Building the system is a conversation.** The user talks to the AI about
their business — the documents they collect, their chart of accounts, banks,
reconciliation, departments, cost centres — and the AI matches that against
its country knowledge (Polish CoA templates, VAT, KSeF…) and proposes
definitions: ObjectTypes, Rules, ViewDefs, eventually whole market packs
(M3), all as drafts behind the same human approval gate rules already have.
The AI "generates visuals during the conversation" without drawing anything:
it drafts a ViewDef and the generic shell renders it with sample data — the
mock-up *is* the artifact; approving it makes it live. Today's agent drafts
one rule from one sample event; phase (a) needs a multi-turn conversation
producing coherent *bundles*. That loop deserves its own design note before
building. Alpha's discovery-session screenplay (its doc 010) is the interview
protocol such an agent should run.

**(b) Operating the system is worklists.** Incoming events, decisions
waiting, notifications — "what do I do now?" next to "how are we doing?".
Rhea has the skeleton (worklist, approvals, simulation); Alpha's cases model
is the maturity target.

## What Alpha teaches (surveyed 2026-10-01)

Alpha (`MojoHand70/Alpha`) is a hand-built ERP for a real client — the
empirical counterpart to Rhea's language experiment. Worth porting in spirit:

- **Cases, not a worklist view** (Alpha doc 017 §5): the work item is an
  *object* — kind, subject, status, deadline, thread, and the one or two
  verbs that resolve it, inline. Raised by the system from events, never
  typed in; closes itself when the world moves on. "An empty list means the
  day's work is done."
- **Live screens** (017 §2): the projector is the only writer, so it is the
  only announcer — a notice per projection write (Postgres NOTIFY), one SSE
  stream per browser tab, rows patch in place. Nobody refreshes. Rhea's
  executor is already the single writer; the same mechanism drops in.
- **The agent is a user** (012): a role with a worklist and typed verbs,
  `actor = agent:<model>` on everything it causes, never on a read path,
  never deciding what a rule decides. Rhea's actor column follows this.
- **The shell** (016): omnibox (⌘K, `>` runs verbs by name), activity bar
  ordered by the life of a business object rather than by department, tabs
  as URLs, assistant panel with the current tab as context.

## Language decisions with a recorded destination

- **Rule cascade.** KK's call (2026-10-02): rules matching *derived* events,
  with atomicity, is the intended end-state (receipt → stock move →
  valuation posting). All-matching-rules-fire (shipped) is the stepping
  stone. Revisit when M2 warehousing demands chains.
- **Conflicts stay human.** Same-object-id claims refuse the event into the
  worklist; semantic double-booking is simulation's job to reveal before
  approval; static conflict detection is parked (SPEC §7).
- **Authz belongs in the language, eventually.** Users, groups and access
  policies should be objects and rules like everything else — a good
  falsifiability test of its own, post-M2. Until then: actor attribution
  only, no auth (experiment non-goal).
- **Multi-company is a ref, multi-tenant is infrastructure.** The operating
  company will be a `company` object (`kind: self`) that events reference;
  tenancy stays out of the experiment.
